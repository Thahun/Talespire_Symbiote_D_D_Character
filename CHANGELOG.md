# Changelog

## 0.2.1
Bugfix: Running multiplier and carrying penalties got lost when persisting
Bugfix: Armors closed when de-/activating them
Added: Race "Dragonkin"
Update: Default state of char select changed to "open"

## 0.2.0
Added: A section for familiars.

## 0.1.1
Added: A field to set special movement for "fly". As distance/speed of fly depends on how a character gains fly, it's not calculated and by that a manual value, not reduces when overloaded. But following rules the lift limit should be still applied.
