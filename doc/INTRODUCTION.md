# Introduction
This symbiote enables you to manage your D&D characters directly in Talespire.
So there's no need anymore to use an external spreadsheet in parallel.

## Start
When starting the Symbiote, you'll see a fresh blank character sheet.
You may directly start to fill it out and use it.

## The menu
The menu allows you to manage your characters.

![Explained menu](screenshots/Menu_Explained.png)

### General options
#### List your existing characters
You'll see the name, owner and Symbiote version of the character.
#### Create a new character
This will simply reset the sheet to start over from scratch. (Don't forget to save your potentially already open character)
#### Import a character
If you exported previously a character or got one provided, you can import it through this. It'll open a file selector in the background.
If the imported character isn't up to the version of the Symbiote, it'll be simply converted to the latest version.

### Character options
#### Load character
It'll simply load this character to the sheet. \
Sections will be opened as in the moment when it was persisted.

![Export menu](screenshots/Loaded_Char.png)

#### Copy character
By this you may copy a character. That means it's loaded to the sheet, but the unique identifier is not set. This allows you to set a new name or owner and persist a copy. \
**Important** Do not use the same combination of character name and owner, this has to be unique.
#### Export character
In case you'd like to e.g. create a backup or simply transfer it, by this you'll get a JSON formated export of your character.

#### Delete character
Handle with care, this will remove the character, permanently. No backup and it'll be gone forever.
#### Convert character
In case you installed a new version of the Symbiote, your character data and view will most probably not fit the new format. This will convert it to the latest version which can then be loaded as usual. \
*Hint* An outdated version of a character can't be copied or loaded, till it's converted. But you may export it, in case you'd like to have a backup.

## Sheet sections

When first opening this section, you'll need to pick your skill set. Afterwards you'll get all the skills of that set where you can set your ranks, if you're allowed to learn that many skills. Attributes are applied automatically and if you're marking a skill as primary for you're char, you'll also get the +3 bonus. \
